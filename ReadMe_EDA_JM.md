# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Description
This exploratory data analysis seeks to find recommendations for a house buyer, who is looking for two houses - one in the city and one in the countryside. 

## Data Sources
- House sales in King County (Year 2014 - 2015)

## Methodology
First, I used box plots and histograms to determine the distribution of numerical values and to find outliers. Outliers for price, sqft_living and sqft_lot were removed in order to obtain a better visualization of distribution on mapbox.

## Results
Key findings:
- Houses above the mean price in King County are concentrated in the Northern parts of King County.
- The highest concentration of expensive houses can be found in Bellevue.
- House prices in our central locations (Capitol Hill, Queen Anne & Fremont) are on average 37% higher than non-central areas.
- In the three central neighborhoods - the average house price and price per square feet is highest in Queen Anne.
- Average grade is highest in Capitol Hill and Fremont has a lower avg. grade than the overall avg. for all houses. 
- Prices for country homes are higher the more north we go and the closer we go to the city. 
- Lot sizes seem to get bigger the further we get away from the city or the more remote the area is. 
- House prices for country homes are on average lower during the winter season and this highest during spring.
